The new Gridiron mode is a one-life competition where players compete to nab a flag and score a "touchdown" in their opponent's area. It's a 5v5 mode, and you score 2 points for a touchdown, 2 for an elimination, or 1 if you're holding the flag when time runs out. The first team to 13 wins. The mode comes complete with custom weapon placements for each map.

Speaking of maps, a new one, Pahanu, has been added. It's a jungle map, complete with an open swamp in the middle. Meanwhile, Gears 1 favorite Canals returns, and Arena and Annex are being added as 2v2 maps.

A new Tour of Duty will also begin with this operation, bringing brand new unlockables to the game. There are even new Xbox Achievements coming, and they'll be tracked retroactively based on your previous stats. The full Achievement list will be revealed on March 30.
